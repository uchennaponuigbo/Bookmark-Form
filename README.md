# Bookmark-Form
This is a Window Form Application that allows you to save your favorite websites (or other text) to a text file without the need to use your web browser's bookmark bar

It is recommended that you create a folder for this form and save all the text files you will make into there. This will help keep everything organized. But it is capable of saving anywhere on the directory.
